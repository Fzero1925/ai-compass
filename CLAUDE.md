This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI tools directory and review platform project designed to create a comprehensive catalog of AI tools with expert reviews and comparisons. The project aims to build a static website that serves as a one-stop directory for AI tools across categories like image editing, text assistance, and productivity tools.

## Project Architecture

### Content Structure
- **Homepage**: Tool category overview with navigation to different AI tool categories
- **Category Pages**: Grouped AI tools by function (e.g., image editing, text tools, productivity)
- **Tool Detail Pages**: Individual pages for each AI tool with comprehensive reviews

### Page Template Structure
Each tool detail page follows a standardized 6-module layout:
1. **Tool Introduction** (工具简介) - Basic description and purpose
2. **Core Highlights** (核心亮点) - Key features and differentiators  
3. **Use Cases** (使用场景) - Practical applications and target users
4. **Community Reviews** (社区及评测引用) - User feedback and external reviews
5. **Access Information** (使用渠道说明) - How to access and use the tool
6. **FAQ/Notes** (FAQ／注意事项) - Common questions and important considerations

## Development Approach

### Deployment Strategy
- Static site deployment via GitHub Pages
- SEO optimization with proper meta tags, structured data, and internal linking
- Google Analytics and Search Console integration for traffic monitoring

### Content Management
- Modular structure allows easy addition of new tools following the established template
- Each tool gets its own dedicated page for SEO optimization
- FAQ sections structured for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

### Monetization Integration
- Pre-configured AdSense auto-ad placement areas
- Structure prepared for potential affiliate links and promotional content

## Current Status

This is a documentation-only project at the planning stage. No code implementation exists yet - only comprehensive project specifications and architectural planning documents.
